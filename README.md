## System Information Logger

This project demonstrates the use of core Node.js modules to perform basic system operations and file handling.

### Features

- **System Information**: Retrieves and displays the current platform and architecture
- **Path Construction**: Demonstrates proper path joining across different operating systems
- **File Operations**: Creates, writes to, and reads from files using asynchronous methods
- **Error Handling**: Implements proper error handling for all file system operations

### Core Modules Used

- **os**: For retrieving system information
- **path**: For platform-independent path manipulation
- **fs**: For file system operations

### How to Run

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your computer
2. Clone this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
4. Run the script with:
   ///////
   node app.js
   ////////

### What it Does

When you run this script, it will:
1. Display your system's platform and architecture
2. Create a file path by joining directory and file name
3. Create a directory if it doesn't exist
4. Write your system information to a file
5. Read the file contents and display them

### Learning Outcomes

This project demonstrates understanding of:
- Working with Node.js core modules
- Asynchronous programming with callbacks
- File system operations
- Error handling techniques
- Path manipulation

### Requirements Met

- Uses only built-in Node.js modules
- Implements asynchronous methods for file operations
- Includes proper error handling
- Provides clean code with descriptive comments
>>>>>>> eb3015c (1.Added system information logger using Node.js core modules. 2.Retrieved and displayed system platform and architecture. 3. Constructed file paths using the path module. 4  Created and wrote system info to a text file. 5.- Reads and displayed file contents using asynchronous methods. 6.All operations uses built-in Node.js modules (os, path, fs) with proper error handling.)
